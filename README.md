# spectra

Simple web app for color conversion and interpolation. Host (say, "python -m http.server") and select from several interpolation options:

* Beginning and end colors

* Number of interpolation samples

* Color "space" in which to interpolate

The resulting points in color space will appear/update on the RHS automatically. Each color "splotch" also includes the encoding in several formats for easy copy-paste to/from your favorite editor or design tool.
